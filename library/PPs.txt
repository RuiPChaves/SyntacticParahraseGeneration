by accident
by becoming more selfish
by a well
by unknown means
by an extraordinary sequence of events
by the light of the moon
by mistake
by the boulder
by the light of a candle
by chance
by the low boughs of the maple trees
by two charming little horses
by force
by some trivial coincidence
by a high barbed-wire fence
by the rail fence
by a thick screening of barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it
by the steering wheel
by tourist attractions
by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green shade of florist's grass
by the car
by a tall pine tree
by that truck
by the window
by an iron stove
by the river
by shards of what had once been the side window
by three cases of beer
by the shrubbery
by the seashore
by lamplight
by moonlight
by the steel mill where my grandfather worked for thirty-four years
by the Tiber
by the border
by Baltimore
by the airport
by the entrance
by the edge of the water
by his childhood home
by the university
by the bridge over the Thames
by the lake
by the new unit's main stamping plant
by the antiquated facility
by the twenty-three busiest airports
by the company's nuclear plant
by the plant
by the pole
by the GOP demand
by a placard reading 'Save Our Youth'
by the main stand
by the top of the heap
by a settlement with striking steelworkers
by the floor
by the Arctic Circle
by the end of October
by the Cambodian border
by the bottom
by the ocean
by an electrical generating plant
by the academy
by the Nicaraguan border
by the Mexican border
by the Israeli border
by the surface of the water
by a Lyons plant operated by American Salt Co., a business sold by General Host last February
by the East German border, where the French are learning to work with German soldiers in a German-French brigade
by the tank
by the nation's largest oil fields in Prudhoe Bay
by the TV studios
by a bar
by an actual table
by the refugee and rebel camps along the Afghan border
by the lofty $3 million-a-year neighborhood
by the East and West coasts
by the U.S. Embassy
by the northern town of La Esperanza
by the Cuban coastline
by the attention focused on the problem
by a ski area
by the infield
by a sign marking the spot where another Texan found a 16-carat diamond in 1975
by the deadline
